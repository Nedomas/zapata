## Collaboration :heart:

It is encouraged by somehow managing to bring a cake to your house. I promise,
I will really try.

This is a great project to understand language architecture in general. A
project to let your free and expressionistic side shine through by leaving meta
hacks and rainbows everywhere.

Thank you to everyone who do. I strongly believe that this can make the
developer job less robotic and more creative.
